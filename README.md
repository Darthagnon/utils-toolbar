# utils-toolbar
Windows taskbar toolbar full of shortcuts to all the Windows settings you could ever need.

Windows has a lot of settings, many of which are well-hidden, difficult to find, or semi-deprecated (but still useful). Starting in Win7, I began collecting shortcuts to all the settings I actually used. This became absolutely vital when I got a Win10 PC, as M$ thought it wise to semi-deprecate the Control Panel and user-friendly settings in favour of the almost-useless Settings App.

## Usage:

1. Download this repo, and extract the zip to a sensible, permanent location on your PC (e.g. ```C:\Windows Tweaks_portable```)

2. Right-click on the taskbar. 

3. Goto ```Toolbars``` >> ```New toolbar``` and browse to the Utils folder from this repo. Click ```Select Folder```

4. On the right side of your taskbar, next to the System Tray, the word ```Utils >>``` should have appeared. It's a dropdown menu with subfolders, and all the shortcuts to all the most useful Windows settings are accessible there.

## Bugs
I made the shortcuts on my personal Win7 and Win10v1709 PCs. They should all work on your version of Windows, since the paths don't change too often, though there are a few shortcuts to Win10-exclusive settings (these are kept to a minimum). I might also have missed changing the paths in some of the shortcuts from hardcoded paths on my PC to environment variable-based paths (which work on every PC). Let me know if I missed any.
